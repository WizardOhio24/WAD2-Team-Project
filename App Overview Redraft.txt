With climate change becoming an increasingly important issue, we would like to create a web app in which people can track extreme weather systems such as storms, tornadoes and extreme heat.  The app will also provide users with information of where these systems are, and any consequences that could arise from them such as flooding and wild fires.\

The app will provide an interactive map that all users can view and navigate.  The map will display pins that denote weather systems of interest and all users will be able to interact with them. Clicking on pins will provide further information about the event; such as the location and specific details such as the immediate impact.\

There will also be the option for users to create an account which will give the user additional benefits.  When logged in, users will be able to edit the map by adding pins if they have details about an extreme weather event.  Additionally, account holders will be able to add favourite locations and events in these locations will be displayed on their feed.
